# Requirements Definition

## Purpose and Background

### Project Purpose
To develop an accessible, AI-driven conversational application called **Archie** that empowers users to interact with multiple AI agents (Logic, Emotion, Instinct) representing distinct perspectives, fostering deeper understanding and personalized feedback.

### Project Background
With the growing demand for personalized AI experiences, the **Archie** app aims to differentiate itself by incorporating multi-agent collaboration, user-controlled memory systems, and privacy compliance. It is designed for casual users and professionals seeking a unique blend of logic, emotion, and intuition in AI interactions.

## System Overview

### Overall System View
The **Archie** system comprises a conversational frontend (React/Flutter), a robust backend (FastAPI/Django), and an AI-driven memory system to recall and adapt to users' preferences. Conversations flow seamlessly between user input, agent collaboration, and aggregated outputs.

### Main System Functions
1. Multi-agent interaction with Logic, Emotion, and Instinct agents.
2. User selection of agents per conversation.
3. Combined feedback aggregation.
4. Basic memory system for adaptive interactions.
5. User-controlled memory privacy settings.
6. Scalable and responsive design.

### System Usage Scenarios
- **Scenario 1**: A user seeks logical advice on a career decision and engages the Logic agent.
- **Scenario 2**: The Emotion agent provides empathetic responses during a reflective conversation.
- **Scenario 3**: A collaborative conversation where Logic, Emotion, and Instinct agents analyze a user's question and provide a unified response.
